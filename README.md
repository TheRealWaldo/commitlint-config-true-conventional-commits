# commitlint-config-true-conventional-commits

Shareable [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) configuration to enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) more closely than the current [opinionated implementation](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/issues/2141).

While I agree with some of what is said, I feel it is much easier to work with a configuration that matches the specification and then build on top of that.
